# 3.1 Modifiers

So far we've dealt exclusively with the "nouns" and "verbs" of Tokawaje. Now, we're going to start increasing the flexibility of tag sequencing even further by adding the fourth grammar prefix: **i-**. When tags are attached to an **i-**, they apply a secondary set of descriptors to the tag(s) immediately to their left. These descriptions do not indicate the "what" of a thing; that would be for the tags directly attached to the **u-**, **a-**, and **e-** concepts. Instead, these describe the temporary or specific qualities attributed to the discussed concept.

Examples - Modifier Introduction:

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**utata avela ehuma.**|That is a person.
|**utata avela ehumavelo.**|That is a deceit-person. (a politician? a spy?)
|**utata avela ehuma ivelo.**|That is a person of lies. (probably a liar)

Contrasting the third example from the second is the inclusion of the **ivelo** modifier on the **ehuma** object concept. When **velo** is directly attached to the **e-** concept, we are conveying that something about the very nature of this human is associated with deceit. On the other hand, when **velo** is indirectly associated with the **e-** concept through an **i-** modifier, we are indicating that the "thing" we are discussing is a human, but that this human has some additional quality about them that makes them worthy of being described as deceitful.
