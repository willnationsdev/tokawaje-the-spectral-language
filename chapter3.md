# 3.1 Modifiers

So far we've dealt exclusively with the "nouns" and "verbs" of Tokawaje. Now we're going to start increasing the flexibility of tag sequencing even further by adding the fourth grammar prefix: **i-**. When tags are attached to an **i-**, they apply a secondary set of descriptors to the tag(s) on the word immediately to their left. These descriptions do not indicate the "what" of a thing; that would be for the tags directly attached to the **u-**, **a-**, and **e-** concepts. Instead, these describe the individual qualities attributed to the discussed concept.

Examples - Modifier Introduction:

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**uhuma.**|Person.
|**uhumavelo.**|Deceit-person. (a politician? a spy?)
|**uhuma ivelo.**|Person of lies. (probably a liar)

Contrasting the third example from the second is the inclusion of the **ivelo** modifier on the **ehuma** object concept. When **velo** is directly attached to the **e-** concept, we are saying that something about the very nature of this human is associated with deceit. On the other hand, when **velo** is indirectly associated with the **e-** concept through an **i-** modifier, we are indicating that the "class" of concept we are discussing is a human, but that this human has some additional quality about them that makes them worthy of being described as deceitful.

Examples - Simple Modifiers:

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**uvowo itatitawa avowazo.**|The back of the caravan is (only slightly) moving forward.
|**usyse isejazo avapo ilyko.**|Nearly all of their number fell, contrary to my preference.
|**usysesejazo avapo ilyko.**|The number that is nearly all of them fell, contrary to my preference.
|**utemi uvapehise ivapahiso avapo ivuti etemi evowehise.**|The wall in the top-right is now down on the ground.
|**utemi uvapehise uvapahiso avapovuti etemi evowehise.**|The top-right-wall (a specific type of wall?) now-falls on the ground.

Traditional parts of speech will enable you to attribute qualities to the "class" of an entity or relation while modifiers allow you to shift tags and their associated meanings away from these "class"-level descriptions and more to the "individual" descriptions for this particular manifestation of that concept. For the examples above, try to understand how the modifiers act as an adjective or adverb whose concept is built up separately from the modified concept. How might the sentence's meaning change if the tags on a modifier were moved over to the modified concept, e.g. if the properties describing the adjective were instead describing the noun?

One aspect to examine in these examples is how sometimes **i-** modifiers will have a substantial impact on the meaning (as in examples 4 and 5) and sometimes they won't (as in examples 2 and 3). In occasional instances, the difference between "class" and "individual" phrasings will be relatively minimal. However, the **usyse** sentences create an opening for confusion by attributing the partial percentage quality as part of the "class" meaning rather than the "individual" meaning of the "number" concept. Clearly the intent is to refer to "most of the Xs" that are referred to in the subject, but by forcing the "most of" description to be *part* of entire concept rather than just a secondary description of that concept, it can mislead the recipient of the message into thinking that the "most of" description is crucial to understanding the concept of the "number". Is this only for "numbers" that are representative of the majority in general? Not likely.

Modifiers can also enable even more fine-tuned descriptions since they can target individual tags and not just the concept as a whole. We can accomplish this by breaking up the concept's tags into multiple words and then inserting modifiers in between those words, as in the examples below.

Examples - Advanced Modifiers:

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**atokasysa itymaseja.**|(I) lecture constantly.
|**atokasysa ityma isejazo.**|(I) lecture most of the time.
|**atokasysa ivutizi itato isejazo.**|(I) lecture RIGHT now (generally speaking), most of the time.
|**atokaza asysazo ivutizi itato isejazo.**|(I) give small, but very dense lectures RIGHT now (generally speaking), most of the time.
|**atoka asysaza ivutizi itato isejazo.**|(I) give a huge lecture RIGHT now (generally speaking), most of the time.

From these examples, we can explicitly see the differences in meaning when particles are attached to root tags mid-concept. From here, we derive the word-targeting principle of Tokawaje as stated previously: *when particles alter the meaning of words they are attached to, they only affect tags attached to the current word, not to the entire concept*. If we only wish to place emphasis on a particular aspect of a concept, an aspect that is critical to the description of that concept and therefore placed towards the front of its total tag-list, then we will need to isolate that tag within its own word in order for it to be targeted exclusively by a particle. If we want a multi-tag subset of all of the concepts tags to be affected, then we simply need to merge those tags into their own word before tagging them all with a particle.

# 3.2 Transitivity

So far, we have only written sentences that portray a static scene with no action: a character has some relationship or has some state, but does not actually do anything to anything else. For that we have to design a transitive verb which no relations in Tokawaje will represent by default.

If we wanted a guide for distinguishing between a relation of state (e.g. **umina avapo emino.** - "I am below you.") and a relation of action in which the state relation is applied from the subject to the object ("I *down* you," i.e. "I push you down," or "I put you down,"), then we need some way to explicitly alter the meaning of the verb to add transitivity and trigger that "apply" effect from the subject to the object. As you might have guessed, we use a particle tag for this, specifically, the **ze** tag. When used on concepts, it provides an "apply" quality.

For nouns, this means that we can construct concepts such as "the application of guardianship" (**upapaze**). No longer discussing a guardian or even guardians in general; no, at this point we are discussing the act of parenting or of acting as a guardian. For relations, this allows us to convey the transitivity we are looking for in our verbs: we can finally say that we "parent" (**apapaze**) something as opposed to saying that we are a parent of something (**apapa**).

Examples - **ze**:

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**umina avapo emino.**|I am below you
|**umina avapoze emino.**|I drop you. I push you down. I let you down. (etc.)
|**upapamanazeza upapemina anisaze eminatati**|*fatherhood* in my family is instilled us.
|**umino emina akynaze alyka.**|You interest me by means of my preferences. ("interest" has "transitivity")
|**umino emina akyna alykaze.**|You get me to like you by means of my interests. ("like" has "transitivity")
|**umino emina akynalykaze.**|You inspire preferential interest in me. ("like-interest" has "transitivity")
|**umino emina alykakynaze.**|You inspire an interested preference in me. ("interest-like" has "transitivity")
|**uvutavowoze aposo.**|Back(?)-Repetition is bad ("the future-ing of something back-ly")
|**uvowovutaze aposo.**|Procrastination is bad ("the push-back-ing of something future-ly")

At this point, we have a variety of tools at our disposal to manipulate the specifics of a concept's semantics:

1. Tag sequencing (what order of priority a tag has in describing the concept).
2. Modifier redistribution (whether to outsource the tag to a modifier or keep it "in-house" in describing the "class" of the concept).
3. Word Separation + Particle Tagging (constraining a particle's influence to a subset of a concept's tags)

We will continue to expand these linguistic mechanics as we learn more of Tokawaje, so it is important that we keep an eye on what can be done with what vocabulary we've learned thus far. Try to experiment with sentence constructions to see what sorts of ideas we can convey using these techniques.

# 3.3 Basic Naming

Because we are adding the **ten** root in this chapter, it is important to include one more small concept. The naming particles **fa**, **fi**, and **fo**. Simply put, adding this particle implies that the following *word* will be a custom term in the language. *All* custom terms in Tokawaje (until they are adapted into the language using **fi**), must use capitalized terms, e.g. "Car" instead of "car".

**fi** implies that the new word should also conform to Tokawaje syntax-constraints (using root/particle consonants and vowels, and having a CVC root form) so that you can effectively create new Tokawaje words on the fly if needed. Doing this is not recommended for beginners, but it should be noted that the language supports this capacity so that people can tinker with the content of official "releases" of the language (for scripting purposes).

**fa** and **fo** allow us to introduce foreign terms, such as names, to the language. This works especially well with the **ten** root for providing an identity to entities and relations.

A note for programmers: Naming is effectively just the creation of macros that inject the associated Tokawaje anytime the referenced name is used.

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**umina ateni efa Will.**|I am known as "Will".
|**uhumi itata ateni efo Zombie.**|That humanoid is known as a "Zombie".
|**utokasysa avela efi Lak. umina alyka elaka.**|Lectures are "lak". I like lectures.

**fa** can give us the exact name of a particular entity whereas if we wish to attach a name to a class of entities, we would use **fo**. **fi**, as you can see, provides opportunities to create new roots. The manifestations of these roots can also be elaborated on expliclty, e.g. **ufi Lako avela utymatokosysa** ("lako" is a large silent period).

# 3.4 Vocabulary Review

This chapter's vocabulary is largely split between words referring to actions, abstract qualities, and some supplemental material.

**tul** and **tuw** deal with the applications of things, either as "to use" or as "to do/work with" generically. **tul** in particular deals with the entire spectrum of usage, involving also the non-use of something and things which inhibit usage. **tuw** similarly indicates the action, inaction, and restful state of something. 

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**utuwaze atoka ekynatuwa imino.**|The act of working speaks to your work-interest.
|**umana atuwa inamo etuwasysaza.**|He works exclusively on large projects.
|**utula imina avapaze elyke inamalykaze imino.**|My usage increases your likeability in the polls (countings of preference).
|**uhumatuwa asejiza ehuma itulaza.**|More than half of workers are *useful* people.

**ten** refers to one's identity, whether they are (in)famous, not famous (but have an identity), and whether they have no identity and/or are anonymous. It is therefore useful for referring to people by name along with having more public titles. You can also convey the secretiveness of the name based on the usage of **ten**.

**mek** is the root responsible for creation, maintenance, and destruction. As such, we can use it for a variety of transitive actions regarding the well-being or state of other entities. **laj** is a leftover from the previous chapter's content regarding positioning: it refers to the range of something, i.e. how far or close it is.

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**umina atena emeka itokawaje.**|I am famously known for the Tokawajan creation.
|**utuwa ameko enisa imina.**|Work destroys my internals.
|**uhumo itatalaja avela uhumopape imina.**|That animal way over there is my pet.
|**umina atenizo efa Batman.**|I am (lesser) known as "Batman".

**taj**, **paw**, and **vyt** are all words that have to do with discussing conflict. **vyt** explicitly refers to conflict along with a temporary (truce) and permanent (peace) lack of conflict. **taj** allows us to refer to the relative excitement of something, ranging from dangerous to exciting to calming. **paw** meanwhile informs us of one's relative power, average-ness, or weakness.

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**utokavyta avela etaji.**|Debates are thrilling.
|**uhumatato alyka evyto.**|Humans like peace.
|**utuwa apawoze emina.**|Work drains me.
|**umina alyka etuwi ipawa.**|I like strong attempts.

**vit**, **loj**, **lov**, and **wem** **vit** is the root for virtuousness, defining the moral standing of the entity or relation. **loj** and **lov** are similar, but deal with loyalty and love, respectively, as opposed to virtue. Finally, **wem** conveys the degree to which something fell within our expectations, providing an avenue for expressing over- and underwhelming feelings.

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**uhumavita itato avitaze ehumatato.**|Heroes inspire virtue in people.
|**uhumopape imina avela uhumoloja.**|My pet is a loyal-animal. (dog?)
|**uhumalova imina ateni efa Rachel.**|My spouse/girlfriend is named Rachel.
|**elojo imanatata awemi.**|His disloyalty is expected.
|**uhumavito isejazo awema epawa ihumavita.**|The villain nearly overwhelms the hero's power.
