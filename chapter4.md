# 4.1 Contexts and Secrets (WIP)

We've already discussed previously how phrases in Tokawaje use an entity-relation-entity syntax rather than a subject-verb-object syntax like many other Western languages. Thus far however, this distinction has been largely ignored. In this chapter, we'll begin to see how this principle takes root with the introduction of *contexts*.

A context is a singular bundle of an entity-relation-entity relationship. That is, it wraps the relation between the left-hand entity and the right-hand entity and enables you to attach it to a part of speech just like any other tag. You can think of the context like a pair of parentheses around the u-a-e prefix structure you've seen so much of.

We can already say things using this structure, such as "I like chatting," (**umina alyka etokaze**), but what if, instead, we wished to say, "I like chatting with you."? Well we could of course say, "I like you-ly chats," **umina alyka etokaze imino**, but that feels slightly awkward and vague given that I'm adjectiving them for speech. How exactly does a particular person quality modify one's conversations?

Rather than rely on the vagueness of modifiers, we can enhance the specificity to create a more direct translation from English using contexts...

Let's assume that in the sentence "I like chatting with you," there are two sets of parentheses surrounding the two separate relations that are present:

( I like (chatting with you) ).

Viewed this way, we can break down our sentences into two parts:

**umina alyka. atoka emino.**

What would be ideal is if we could wrap the content of the second sentence and use it as the **e-** term for the first sentence's right-hand entity. As a matter of fact we *can*, with the introduction of the context particles: **xa** opens a new context (an open paranthesis) and **xo** closes the previous context (a close paranthesis). If multiple **xa** particles are used, and you wish to come down from all of them ( equivalent to ')))', etc. ), then **xu** can be used instead of **xo**. You can assume that every sentence silently starts and ends with **xa** and **xu**, respectively.

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**umina alyka exa atoka emino.**|I like (talk with you).

"I like" is now using the phrase "talk with you" as the object of its relation, i.e. we have converted the **atoka emino** phrase into a noun representation (it has been transformed into a right-hand entity, ergo a noun) and subsequently hooked it up to the previous relation **alyka**. As such, the appropriate translation to English for **exa atoka emino** is "talking with you" rather than "talk with you." It has become a gerund.

Grammatically speaking, we are wrapping the content of the context and turning the entire context into a tag of its own, a tag with no name. If one wished to give such a context a name, they could using the **fa**, **fi**, and **fo** tags from the previous chapter.

Because contexts generate new tags from more complex structures, they still must be attached to parts of speech. We can detect *where* the context is attached by examining where the **xa** and/or **xo** are attached. In the previous example, we are explicitly stating that the context following the **xa**, that is, **atoka emino**, is attached to the right-hand entity with the **e-** in **exa**. Things can get especially crazy if we start moving around how the contexts are constructed or what part of speech they are attached to in the external context.

Examples - **xa** and **xo**:
|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**umina alykaxa atoka emino.**|I (talk with you)-like (it).
|**umina alyka axa atoka emino.**|I (talk with you)-like (it).
|**umina atoka ilyka emino.**|I preferably talk with you.
|**umina alyka uxo atoka emino.**|(I like) talks with you. ("I like" is doing the talking)
|**ulyka imina atoka emino.**|My like (of it) speaks to you. (notice that this is much cleaner)
|**umina alyka axo atoka emino.**|I communicatively-(I-like) you. ("I like" is the relation, with **toka** added as a subsequent tag on the relation)
|**umina alyka exo atoka emino.**|I talk with the you-(I-like).
|**umina atoka eminoxa umina alyka.**|I talk with the you-that-I-like.
|**umina alyka emino uxo ilyko atoka exa alyko exa umino alyko emina.**|The disliked (my-liking-of-you) communicates my dislike of (you-disliking-me).

As mentioned, the final context particle **xu** is used in cases where multiple **xa** particles have been used already and we'd like to collapse all the way down to the base concept rather than having to say an equivalent number of **xo** particles.

Examples - Mixing **xa**, **xo**, and **xu**:
|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**uhuma ixa anisa etati ixa alajo eminatati ixu alyka emino.**|The person (outside the (group near us )) likes you.
|**uhuma ixa anisa etati ixa alajo eminatati ixo alyka emino.**|The person (outside the ( (close-to-us) group that likes you))... (there is no relation for the external context)
|**uhuma ixa anisa etati ixa alajo eminatati alyka emino.**|The person (outside the ( preferably-close you-group))... (there is no relation for the external context)

The sentences above showcase the semantic effect of changing a **xu** to a **xo** as well as removing it entirely: we can end up applying our tags to parts of speech in a preceding context unintentionally, having catastrophic consequences on our intended meaning.

Contexts can provide us with a wealth of flexibility in how we phrase ideas. In English, phrases of this sort (without the parentheses) would be much more vague in their meaning. That ambiguity is removed in Tokawaje's context technique. Combined with other roots like **tym** and **vap**, we can develop all manner of dependent phrases to modify entities and relations such as in the sentence **umina atokasysa ixa aniso evapehise itata,** (I lecture on the other side of that wall).
