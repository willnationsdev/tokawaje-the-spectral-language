# 1.1 Pronunciation and the Alphabet

There are 23 letters in the Tokawaje alphabet.

### Consonants (16)

Every consonant's pronunciation is consistent with a typical European speaker's expectations.

Consonants in tokawaje are split into two groups: roots and particles

|Root Consonants|Sound|Example|
|-|-|-|
|m|/m/|merry, them
|n|/n/|next, ten
|p|/p/|piano, opponent
|t|/t/|ten, out
|k|/k/|count, stock
|v|/v/|value, even
|s|/s/|sell, lease
|h|/h/|humor, aha!
|w|/w/|weep, kiwi
|l|/l/|low, kale
|j|/ʤ/|joke, dojo

|Particle Consonants|Sound|Example
|-|-|-|
|x|/tʃ/|chat, search
|f|/f/|fun, staff
|z|/z/|zebra, ooze
|c|/ʃ/|share, social
|b|/b/|bear, cab

The distinction between the two groups will become more apparent later, suffice it to say that you will be able to identify the type of term you are looking at by examining its first consonant.

### Vowels (7)

The traditional European vowels, (a, e, i, o, u) are pronounced as they are in Spanish and toki pona. Two more English letters (y, q) are used to represent particular diphthongs (combinations of vowel sounds) and are interpreted as standalone vowels in Tokawaje. Note that the sounds of vowels are fixed and therefore do not change based on circumstances.

|Vowels|Sound|Example|
|-|-|-|
|a|/ɑ/ ("ah")|on, calm
|e|/ɛ/ ("eh")|entail, pet
|i|/i/ ("ee")|eat, feet
|o|/o/ ("oh")|own, stone
|u|/u/ ("oo")|oo-la-la, food
|y|/ɑi/ ("ai")|island, cry
|q|/ɑu/ ("ow")|ounce, crown

### Capitalization

The official words of Tokawaje's core dictionary are never capitalized. This includes at the start of sentences. Capitalized words are therefore reserved for words that have been manually added to the language on the fly such as if a speaker introduces a custom word of their own, for example, a particular name for something. This practice is consistent with toki pona.

### Punctuation

Tokawaje permits the following punctuation characters: . ! ? , : "

### A Spectral Language: Roots and Suffixes

Words in Tokawaje function very differently from typical natural languages. The fundamental principle is that individual words are in fact simply pairings between a part of speech and the tags that describe them. The table above gives an example of 9 such tags. Technically speaking, each word has the following format:

1. A grammar prefix, indicating a part of speech.
2. One or more tags helping to describe the properties of the part of speech. Tags in turn are made up of...
  * A root concept representing a spectrum of ideas.
  * A precision suffix to narrow the meaning to a particular point on the spectrum.

In a moment, we'll examine the grammar prefix; however, it is the latter element that really simplifies the process of learning Tokawaje: by explicitly anchoring multiple, related ideas in a single root word, we can simplify the task of memorizing and understanding a wider variety of concepts. In examining the table of vocabulary above, you might feel a little overwhelmed with such a large rush of terms right at the start, but try to relax. Understanding the way concepts are constructed will make things much easier to process.

Every root in Tokawaje is made up of three letters: a root consonant, a vowel, and another root consonant. These root consonants are derived from the list you previously reviewed in the alphabet section (1.1). Each root provides a range of meanings that are available to it, and a precision suffix is then appended to the root to select a particular meaning.

For example, the **vel** in the word **vela** is the root that narrows our meaning to the topic of truth and reality. If you examine its corresponding spectrum of ideas, you'll notice that **vel** encompasses the full range of the truth spectrum, not just truth. Adding an **a**, the positive suffix, to get **vela** is what singles out the meaning of truth precisely. If we were to use the negative precision suffix for **velo**, then we would have the word which opposes truth, namely a lack of truth or falsehood. The neutral state of a word, those ending in **i**, will often times yield meanings that are not quite at either extreme. For example, **veli** means "not truth", but also "not falsehood". An applicable illustration of this concept is in symbolism where one indeed refers to a true something, but not at all as it appears in reality, i.e. a half-truth or allegory. Another example would be **min**, the reference topic where **mina** is a reference for "self", **mino**, a reference for "you", and **mini** for "he/she/it/other".

### Sentence Structure: Entities and Relations

Every word in Tokawaje allows one to match properties to a part of speech. However, parts of speech in Tokawaje are also quite different from traditional languages. Where most languages have a subject-verb-object structure, Tokawaje employs an entity-relation-entity structure. The roots within an entity or relation may be the same (for example, **vela** could potentially show up in both an entity and a relation), but their meaning may be different depending on what type of word it is in. Let's start with the most basic of sentences first: some entity has some state or does some action which we will refer to as a relation. How do we tell the difference between the left-hand entity and the relation? With a grammar prefix!

**u** is the prefix associated with entities that have a relation, i.e. the "relating" entity. This is similar to a subject. Relations themselves use the **a** prefix and function like verbs and prepositions in English. We've already covered **vel** and **min**, so let's dive into our first Tokawaje sentence with those:

**umina avela.**

Can you guess what this sentence means? In a literal sense, it means "The self-entity has a truth-relation." The first word's starting **u** informs us that the mina tag or quality is to be attributed to the relating entity, i.e. the subject of the relation, while the second word's **a** tells us that the vela tag is part of the relation. The closest example of this concept in English is the sentence "I am," or "I exist."

To change the relating entity for the relation, all we need to do is alter the precision suffix of the left-hand entity as needed:

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**umina avela.**|I exist.
|**umini avela.**|He/She/It exists.
|**umino avela.**|You exist.

Altering the nature of the truth-relation is manipulated the same way:

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**umina avela.**|I exist.
|**umina aveli.**|I partially exist.
|**umina avelo.**|I don't exist.

To begin incorporating objects into our sentences, we must include the third grammar prefix **e** which marks any tags as being part of the "related" entity, i.e. the object of the phrase in English.

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**umina avelo evela.**|I am not real.
|**umino avela eveli.**|You are a symbol (that which is neither true nor false).
|**umini aveli evelo.**|It is kind of false.

Notice how in these examples, we interpret the verb to switch from "exists" to "is/are/am" due to the presence of a related entity. This is what I meant by the meaning of a tag changing based on the context. That is, the comparative English translation must be handled somewhat differently.

As you can see, sometimes we see the "object" as a noun and other times, as an adjective. All you are really communicating is that some relationship on the "truth" spectrum is tying together two entities that exhibit the properties of the tags describing them - without us knowing exactly what the nature of that entity is. In this sense, the language is still rooted in ambiguity to a lesser extent: Our ability to interpret information from the language is directly tied to the list of descriptions we have thus far associated with the entities and relationships we are discussing.

This distinctions-only approach to understanding an idea is exactly what makes the language more accessible for computers: a software program will take the same approach, attempting to narrow down what idea is being described based on context clues and making an educated guess about the speaker's intent for a word. Tokawaje merely brings human speech down to the level the computer understands so that every speaker is interpreting things on the same level.

Note also that if you wish to refer to the entirety of a spectrum, i.e. "the concept of references to entities" (not just me, it, or you in particular), you would use the **e** suffix to narrow in on that broader idea, resulting in **mine**. The concept of all ideas on the truth spectrum is similarly constructed with **vele**. This will become important later when we come to designing questions or more generic statements where the specifics of the context are unknown.

Fun fact: Tokawaje's grammar permits the creation of somewhat confusing semantics. For example, what does **avele** mean? We are attaching all of the truth spectrum as a descriptor for the nature of a relationship, a confusing idea to replicate in English to say the least. One might say such a relationship is conflicted, if it's possible to exist at all. Therefore, while it isn't implausible to concoct inequitable phrases in Tokawaje that aren't possible elsewhere, its up to the speakers to decide whether the idea communicated even makes sense, just as an odd phrasing in English might not make sense between generations as the language evolves.

Finally, take the following example as an illustration of how sentence structures can be moved around:

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**umina avela evela.**|I am real.
|**evela, umina avela.**|I am real. (positioned as "Real, I am")
|**avela umina evela.**|I am real. (positioned as "Am I real")

The positioning of words has no effect on the resulting meaning behind them so long as they are matched to the same prefix. You'll see also that the comma was completely ignored. This is because, as far as Tokawaje is concerned, commas are purely cosmetic and serve no purpose in interpreting the concepts conveyed by the language. Ultimately all that matters is the relationships between the tags and their associated concepts. With that said, general convention will have sentences follow a subject-relation-object pattern. Later on however, we'll discover more complex patterns available to a Tokawajan speaker.

# 1.3 Vocabulary Review

So, we've already covered the reference and truth tags. The next two tags are **pos** and **waj**. **pos** is to refer to the positivity or generic "good" of something whereas **waj** is used to refer to parts of a spectrum in association with Tokawaje terms.

Examples - **waj**:

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**uwaja avela aposa.**|A-terms are positive.
|**uwaji avela aposi.**|I-terms are neutral.
|**uwajo avela aposo.**|E-terms are negative.
|**uwaje avela apose.**|Spectral terms involve the full positive-negative spectrum.

Note that **waj** is specifically associated with references to Tokawajan grammar roles and therefore only has a loose semantic correlation to the terms "subject", "verb", and "object" in English. If one wished to refer to "subject", they would need to use other terms (beyond the scope of this chapter) to convey that idea in particular.

The next pair of spectra to address are **man** and **pap**.

The **man** root allows one to attribute a gender quality to a term using a spectrum of masculine to feminine. This allows for the attribution of not only masculinity and femininity (using **mana** and **mano** respectively), but also gender-neutrality and pan-gender qualities (using **mani** and **mane** respectively). This permits the discussion of gender roles, but in future chapters, we will learn ways of combining concepts to form more nuanced ideas.

Using **pap** means to attribute a familial quality to something, ranging on a spectrum from parenthood/guardianship to childcare. To refer to "family" as a general thing, one may use **pape**; however, describing someone as an actual family member would require a more specific suffix: **papa** for a parent, **papi** for a sibling, and **papo** for a child. The exact meaning doesn't necessarily mean a biological relationship, but purely how one perceives the relationship, i.e. one could conceivably use **papa** in reference to someone who is their adopted father or who has been like a father to them (if they would ordinarily call them "father" or some such). Later on, we'll explore new concepts that allow us to communicate more extreme aspects of the family tree such as "grandfather", etc.

Examples - **man**, **pap**:

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**umano avela epapa.**|The woman is a mother.
|**upapa aposa epape.**|The parent is good to the family.
|**uposo apapo evelo.**|Negativity is the offspring of lies.
|**upapi avela emane.**|The sibling is intersex.
|**umane amane emane.**|All genders have all gender associations with each other.

The last three vocabulary terms to cover are **lyk**, **hum**, and **kyn**, associated with likability, humanity, and interest, respectively.

At this point, I'm sure you're starting to see a trend in how the words tend to work. **lyk** can be used to express the degree to which you like, are ambivalent towards, or dislike someone or something (**lyka**, **lyki**, and **lyko**), while **kyn** will show interest, boredom, or repulsion. Don't confuse **lyki** and **kyni** however; after all, one can be interested in learning more about something despite the fact that they do not "like" it, e.g. news of a death in the community. They are spectra that are associated with different trains of thought and therefore have each been granted their own perpendicular concepts in Tokawaje.

**hum** is what one uses when they wish to refer to a person, animal, or other willful, physical entity. **huma** will pertain to humanity (and as such can work both as "a human" or "person" (u/e-huma) and as "to make human" (ahuma). Consequently, the term can also be used to refer to humanoids or the full range of living creatures. In the future, you'll find that there are many terms that can be used to describe an animal, depending on what qualities it has and choosing the appropriate word(s) will become an art learned with experience. Tokawaje will never be used as a means of scientifically naming all of the exact characteristics of creatures in the world, but it is specific enough that we can convey a sense of our semantic intent through simple speech.

Examples - **lyk**, **hum**, **kyn**:

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**uhuma avela ekyni.**|The person is boring.
|**upapo alyka ehumo.**|The child likes the animal.
|**umina akyna ehume.**|I am interested in all living creatures.
|**umini ahuma.**|It "human"s. (uh...what?)

Most of these are self explanatory at this point, however the last one is a bit odd. In this sentence, all we are saying is that the "it" **umini** exists is doing some action or existing in some state (e.g. "It burns", "It sleeps") that is most characterized by attributing the concept of humanity to the action or state. Quite literally, "It humans." To say that it *is* human would be **umini avela ehuma.**

Through all of these examples, notice the large diversity of concepts that can be communicated already with these 9 root words alone. Part of the difficulty in learning Tokawaje isn't in the actual memorization of terms, but rather in culminating the inventive and creative application of these qualities to parts of speech one is not used to normally. In fact, many of the terms in Tokawaje are English cognates meaning that they are structured so that they will sound similar to words with a related meaning in English (**huma** is "human", **mana** is "man", **posa** is "positive", etc.). This technique was used specifically to help make learning Tokawaje easier. In subsequent chapters, we'll learn more sophisticated ways of building up concepts and assigning relationships between them.
