# 2.1 Word Composition & Tag Sequencing

In this chapter, we'll begin to examine how new concepts are created by putting together tags.

The simplest way to introduce the concept of word composition is to think of compound words in English. The word "bedroom" is merely a combination of the words "bed" and "room", indicating that the room is used to store a bed and is also associated with all of the accompanying connotations surrounding a bed: a place to sleep, a place to relax, a private space belonging to an individual, etc. Word composition in Tokawaje works in a similar manner, but with a few caveats.

If we examine the root **tok** in the vocabulary, we'll find that it is the "communication" tag. At this point, in combination with the **waj** root from the previous chapter (referring to grammar spectra), we can actually begin to break down the construction of **tokawaje**.

Examples - Word Composition with **toka** and **waje**:

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**utoka.**|Communication.
|**uwaje.**|Pan-Grammar-Spectrum.
|**utokawaje.**|Spectral Communication.
|**uwajetoka.**|All grammar manifestations associated with the toka term.
|**utoka uwaje.**|Spectral Communication
|**uwaje utoke.**|All grammar manifestations on the toke spectrum.
|**uwaja utoka.**|The positive communication term toka.

We can see that when **toka** and **waje** are used in sequence, the **waje** tag has an adjectival effect on the **toka** tag. That is, **waje** is used as a descriptor for the main tag **toka**. Likewise, when the positioning is reversed such that **toka** follows **waje**, the meaning changes so that **toka** is helping to describe the way in which the subject is **waje**, i.e. a communication-related grammar spectrum. This is because of a highly important concept in Tokawaje called "Tag Sequencing."

As mentioned in the first chapter, words in Tokawaje merely attach tags to a part of speech. In the above examples, a singular concept is delivered for each part of speech. The first tag mentioned, the main tag, is used to signify the primary "what" of the object, and then, in decreasing significance, other tags are attached to that main tag to further describe and hone in on the true meaning of the concept being conveyed. This is why the meaning changes so extremely when the first tag is changed to something else as in the contrasting examples **utokawaje** and **uwajetoka**.

Notice also how in the last few examples, the **u-** prefix is repeated for each tag, separating the tags out into multiple words, but still contributing to the same concept in the same part of speech. The flexibility to break up words in this manner is the deepest illustration of the previous chapter's principle that words merely attach tags to a part of speech. Multiple words can be used, but it will function in the same manner as having all of the tags linked together into one gigantic word; however, it is recommended to keep individual words to 2 or 3 tags at the most in order to keep the language clean and legible for readers.

Another point worth noting is that repeat tags have no effect on the meaning. **utokatoka** means "communication" just as much as **utoka** and does not convey any additional emphasis on the concept. This does not hold true for different tags on the same spectrum however. **utokatoko** would roughly translate to "ineffective communication", i.e. "communication that has a lack of communication". However, observe that this meaning also sounds eerily similar to **utoki** ("miscommunication"), the "neutral state" of the **toke** spectrum. This won't always be the case since it depends on the type of spectrum represented by the root; however, we can still perceive a difference between the two. For example, if someone is speaking to us and we completely did not understand anything they said, **utokatoko** might be a better construction of that concept than **utoki** where we may have simply misunderstood something we definitely heard them say.

Examples - Word Composition:

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**uhumaposo atokalyko emina.**|The bad person spoke unfavorably towards me.
|**uhumo avela elykimane.**|The animal doesn't care what gender it is. (lit. "The animal is gender-ambivalent.")
|**upapamano apapaposa emina.**|(My) mother takes good care of me.
|**upapamanamina atoko evelo.**|My father does not lie. ("lacks any false communication")

In each of these examples, we can see multi-tag words: the secondary tag fulfills a supporting role in elucidating the meaning of the first, main tag. Combining tags in this way builds new concepts from the basic ideas we've already learned. Furthermore, this will allow us to create unfamiliar constructions in English, such as "gender-ambivalence" which, while certainly possible to communicate (since we have clearly done so), are still strange combinations to be seen in language. Leveraging the ease with which Tokawaje merges concepts together is what will enable one to truly master it.

# 2.2 Emphasis Shifting

Let's revisit the question opened in the previous chapter regarding composition of the "grandparent" concept. **upapa** is the word for "parent", but we just finished learning that **upapapapa** wouldn't work as a means of creating "grandparent" since it merely applies the "parent" description to the subject concept redundantly. Part of the reason for this is to reduce distractive repetition in the language. In place of repeating an entire tag all over again, Tokawaje has "particles" to help it.

Particles are similar to roots in that they apply additional meaning to a concept, but they are comprised of only one particle consonant (plus the vowel that all tags must end in). Root versus particle consonants are what will allow us to distinguish between root and particle tags. The three particle tags we will examine in this chapter are **za**, **zi**, and **zo**.

**za** is the positive shift tag. It allows us to emphasize a particular aspect of a spectrum in the direction of its -a meaning. For example, when paired with **upapa** ("parent"), we get **upapaza** (literally, "very parent") which indicates the concept is even more parent-like in its nature. This is the syntax used to enhance the **-a**-ness of a concept beyond its original meaning. As such, **upapaza** is the appropriate composition for conveying the "grandparent" concept.

Likewise, **zo** is the negative shift tag and will shift the meaning of a tag towards the negative end of the spectrum. Combining these particle tags into a single word has a canceling-out effect much like repeated root tags, e.g. **upapazazo** is equivalent to **upapa**.

Finally, **zi** is the neutral shift tag. It has the effect of lessening the impact of the other two or emphasizing the neutral state for **waji** roots.

Unlike most root and particle tags, **za**, **zi**, and **zo** are able to be re-used for additional emphasis, so **upapazaza** would be the appropriate translation for "great-grandfather".

Examples - **za**, **zi**, and **zo**:

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**umina alykaza ehumo!**|I really like animals!
|**upapizo avela ekynizi.**|(My) child-like (younger?) sibling is very boring.
|**umina avela ehumatokaza**|I am a strong speaker (someone skilled in communication).
|**umani avela ehumizo.**|It is more beast than human.
|**umani avela ehumazi.**|It is (not quite) human.
|**umani avela ehumazo.**|It is (not quite) human.

As we can see from these samples, **za** and **zo** are not a clear indication of "very" since they shift meaning along the spectrum, but they can function as "very" and "slightly" for terms on the end of the spectrum, i.e. the **waja** and **wajo** (**-a** and **-o** terms). If we wished to emphasize the neutral state of something, as in the second example's **ekynizi**, then we would use **zi**. Because the modified root tag is already neutral, the **zi** serves to emphasize this neutral state, conveying a sense of "very" in the translation. In addition, **za**, **zi**, and **zo** have equal "shifting" ability when applied to words as illustrated by the last two examples.

# 2.3 Vocabulary Review

The vocabulary in this chapter is split up into four sections. The first one includes **tat**, **nam**, **sej**, and **sys**.

Each of them allows us to add some quantitative descriptions to our concepts. **tat** conveys the spectrum of specificity and therefore allows us to target a particular (this or that person), collective (these or those people), or generalized (people) entity. **nam** (as in "number"), **sej** (perCEntAGE), and **sys** (size) will convey the corresponding amount-oriented ideas. **nam** is used in cases where we are counting a high or low number of discrete items. **sej** is for communicating the empty-ness or fullness of something (how it compares to 100%). **sys** will allow us to more explicitly state "very" or "slightly" when tagged onto other concepts, but on its own, it corresponds simply to the amount or size of something.

Examples - **tat**, **nam**, **sej**, and **sys**:

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**utatiseja atokasysa.**|All of them lecture. ("do big talks")
|**umina atokatata evelasejaza.**|I speak only the whole truth.
|**unama alyki evelosyso.**|Many don't care about small lies.
|**unamasejizo avela epapomina.**|Nearly half of them are my kids.

The next group of tags have to do with space and time: **tym**, **vut**, **tem**, and **sek**.

**tym** is the spacetime spectrum, allowing us to talk about time itself (**tyma**), space (**tymo**), and aspects of reality that lie outside those four dimensions (**tymi**). When wanting to refer to particular aspects of time or discuss timelines, we use the timeline spectrum root **vut** (as in "fut-ure") where the spectral case represents a timeline and the positive, neutral, and negative versions correspond to the future, present, and past, respectively. **tem** and **sek** both give us access to cube and sphere related dimensional concepts, reducing ideas from three dimensions, to two dimensions, and then to the lowest level available to their given shape (line for cube, point for sphere).

Examples - **tym**, **vut**, **tem**, and **sek**:

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**utati aseja etymo.**|They fill the place.
|**umina akyna esekavuta.**|I am interested in crystal balls.
|**umina alykozo etymatatatato.**|I really dislike those times.
|**umina ateki.**|I lay flat. (lit. "I square")

The third group entails a pair of basic concepts, although we've already covered one: **tok** and **taw**.

**tok** is for communication, as we've said, through the examples, we may have seen that its usage can be a bit vague. Sometimes it corresponds to a language, a speech or lecture, or even just a single statement. It is therefore a general-purpose term that will frequently require clarification of its meaning through its combinations with other tags. **taw** on the other hand is very explicit in its meanings. It conveys translational movement, moving from one place to another. The spectrum corresponds to going (**tawa**), staying (**tawi**), and coming (**tawo**), when used as a relation, but its subject/object variations include concepts such as travel, a visit, or an arrival, among other things.

Examples - **tok** and **taw**:

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**umino atawi etokasysa.**|You attend a lecture.
|**uhumasysi alyka etawa.**|Some people like travel.
|**uhumolyka atawo etymomina.**|My preferred kind of animal (dog?) showed up at my place.
|**utyma avelanama etawasysahuma.**|Time is the sum of all the great movements of people.

The rest of the words are directionality terms used to refer to the various axes of space: **vap**, **his**, **vow**, and **nis**.

These are pretty straightforward. **vap** is for up/down or above/below, **his** for left/right, **vow** for forward/backward or ahead/behind, and **nis** is for inside/outside as well as an edge or surface. The neutral states of **vap**, **his**, and **vow** refer to the "center" of each spectrum in turn. **nis** however is a bit more particular since its neutral form can be used to describe things like skin, bark, or a countertop (the actual surface of the counter).

Examples - **vap**, **his**, **vow**, and **nis**:

|Tokawaje|English|
|-|-|
|**useka atawaniso etemo.**|The ball exits the line.
|**uvapa avela avapo.**|Up is down.
|**alyka etemihisa.**|I like the left-path.
|**utati avowa emina.**|They are ahead of me.

As an aside, earlier we examined the meaning of **utokatoko** ("ineffective communication") in comparison to **utoki** ("miscommunication") and found that they represented very similar, albeit distinct, concepts. To illustrate how some words can have much more distinct differences between their neutral and positive-negative or negative-positive forms though, we'll examine **tat**. With **tat**, we find a much more clear distinction: **utatatato** refers more to the generalized variation of a particular thing (as one might say, pointing to a computer, "computers like that blah-blah-blah") whereas **utoki** ("those") would very clearly be meant as referring to a particular group. Furthermore, switching it up into **utatotata** holds the completely separate meaning of, "a particular generality." It simply goes to show that the word choice and sequencing has a substantial effect on the subtleties of a concept, a growing trend we'll be tracking as we expand our understanding of Tokawaje.
